# Chandrayaan-1 Mission Local Data Dictionary (LDD)

The Chandrayaan-1 mission dictionary contains a class with attributes specific to the 
        Chandrayaan-1 mission and instruments. This dictionary was created for the migration
        of Chandrayaan data products from PDS3 to PDS4. Currently this includes Mini-RF and M3.
